# Algorithmic Toolbox

C# solutions for the [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox)
Coursera course.

> The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising
> frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, 
> dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for
> searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes 
> sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies.

The course is structured into six weeks, addressing different topics:

- Week 1 and 2: General programming challenges, and warm-up,
- Week 3: Greedy Algorithms,
- Week 4: Divide and Conquer,
- Week 5 and 6: Dynamic Programming.
